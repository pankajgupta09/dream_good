                                The Canadian Start up-Up Visa is an outstanding immigration route for eligible entrepreneurs to start or
                                expand a business in Canada. Accepted applicants will be granted unconditional, irreversible Permanent
                                Residence status in Canada based on their plans to start a business in the country. Itâ€™s not like specific
                                company initiatives that give out temporary permits. The visa is permanent and irrevocable for the entire
                                family under this program.
